## Code formatting
Code formatting checks are automatically performed during build phase.
If the code is not well formatted an error is raised blocking the maven build.
Helpful commands:
```sh
mvn spotless:check # --> used to perform format checks
mvn spotless:apply # --> used to format all misformatted files
