## Code formatting
Code formatting checks are automatically performed during build phase.
If the code is not well formatted an error is raised blocking the maven build.
Helpful commands:
```sh
mvn spotless:check # --> used to perform format checks
mvn spotless:apply # --> used to format all misformatted files

|--------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| patch              | Application version       | Patch-bump application version into pom.xml and Chart app version |
| minor              | Application version       | Minor-bump application version into pom.xml and Chart app version |
